The fault coverage for the 0.15ns/0.10ns path delay fault simulations were exactly the same. Having the same total faults, detected faults, and fault coverage means that--- from one timing to the next--- no additional delay faults were found on the critical paths tested (i.e., the paths not detected in the 0.15ns simulation had significant enough slack to also not be detected in the 0.10ns simulation). Between simulations, there was one more pattern for the 200 critical path simulation with 0.15ns clock than 0.10ns clock. This means that with the faster clock, fewer patterns were necessary to sensitize a delay long enough to detect. The CPU times were roughly the same for each simulation.

\caption{Results for small delay defects, 1.2ns clock period}
\end{table}
The delay-effectiveness for almost all simulations using 1.2ns clock period (with the sole exception of 15\% slack) was much lower than for the 1.1ns clock period simulations of the same slack-percentage. This means that fewer of the small delay defects could be detected in a circuit with a higher clock period. This is potentially because the small delay defects for a higher clock period (but with same percentage slack) have a longer path to sensitize--- so fewer tests will be able to do so. The SDQL values for the 1.1ns simulations are relatively higher than those for their 1.2ns simulation counterparts. This is most-likely the case because of the delay-defect distribution (i.e., there are more small-delay defects that with little slack when the clock period is relatively smaller). The CPU times stayed relatively the same.

\caption{Results for small delay defects, 1.0ns clock period}
\end{table}
The delay-effectiveness is generally higher (with the exception of 10\% slack simulation) for the 1.0ns clock period simulations when compared to the 1.1ns clock period simulations. This most-likely means that there were shorter path lengths of the detected defects (within the slack-percentage), because the allowed slack was smaller. So, more shorter paths counted towards delay-effectiveness in the 1.0ns simulations. SDLQ fluctuated for the 1.1ns and 1.0ns simulations for which was higher for a given slack-percentage. Delay-effectiveness and SDQL was generally lower for the 1.2ns simulations compared to the 1.0ns simulations (presumably for similar reasons to the ones discussed in part ii).
